    <description>Check out where it all started! In the Garden of Eden!  Battle The Serpent and recieve a reward! If you choose to disobey.....

This mod adds:
 - 1 new room: The Garden
 - 1 new item pool: The Garden Pool 
   - 11 new items
 - 1 new challenge: Genesis 
 - 1 new curse: Curse of Mortality
 - 1 new boss: The Serpent 
 - 1 new music track 
 - 1 new SFX 

Shortcomings of the API:
-While my original intention was to add a single new room (a Library) and use that unique room, at the time the API would not let me determine if the player was in a unique room in this case.  
Thus, all Libraries are replaced by The Garden Room.
-The API also will not let me queue music and thus, The Garden Rooms tracks were not all used.

Collaboration:
