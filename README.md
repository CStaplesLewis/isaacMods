# The Web Mod:
Challenge rooms have a small chance to become a web room.
This is a wave defense room with only spider enemies that pays out in a special item (or 2 spider items). This enters the moment you begin.

# Misc Mods (considering making these for practice):
**Belly bean** - belly gets real big and knocks enemies back. Only your belly

**Toy soldier** - familiar that shoots plastic bullets

**Runny nose** - random snot bubble shots (poison knock back)

**Toilet paper** - ground liquids have no effect on you

**Jack in the box** - jacks pop out from you in the direction you are shooting randomly. Instant kill.

**180 gram vinyl** - you now shoot vinyl records and have a beanie, hipster glasses, and hipster beard
