### Item Details
 * Afraid
   * Effecy: At the point in which your tears begin falling to the floor, instead they freeze in place. (and possibly shake? possibly clear the room after 15 tears?)
   * Item Look: Black Scared Cat -- not at all resembling guppy, as this does not count towards the transformation (http://tinyurl.com/jdk2msf)
   * Costume: Isaac has a back cat's tail (very similar to the Gnawed leaf costume)

 * The Beast
   * Effect: Isaac gains a familiar who travels the room punching his fists down on the ground. (causeing small rock erupption effects)
   * Item Look: see below (the item should look like the beast)
   * Costume: none
