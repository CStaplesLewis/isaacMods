**The Garden Room:** A room that randomly replaces a library (40% chance)

Look and feel: The Garden has ivy key locks on the outside door. The music in this room is mainly crickets, jungle sounds, quietness, no music, just SFX.
Effect: If entered, the floor becomes much harder. Specifically, if a player is playing normal, the floor becomes "hard" difficulty. If the player is playing hard, the floor gains the champion belt effect.

Specialty: 
* Has its own item pool
* Item pedestals in this room will reroll their items 1 time just by entering and exiting. 
 * The third time you enter the room, all items will become Exiled and will not change from that item. 
 * Exiled cannot be rerolled. 
* Eternal hearts and broken hearts have a high chance to spawn in this room. (50%).
* Discovering the garden unlocks the Genesis challenge.
* This room's item, if picked up, will trigger a fight with The Serpent. (Consider this not being the item, but rather a tree with the forbidden fruit on it)
 * The Serpent is planned to be a reskin of Pin that shoots apples (knockback). :clock3:
 * The music played before, during, and after the Serpent fight should be different and follow the theme. :white_check_mark:

# The Web Mod:
Challenge rooms have a small chance to become a web room.
This is a wave defense room with only spider enemies that pays out in a special item (or 2 spider items). This enters the moment you begin.

# Misc Mods (considering making these for practice):
**Belly bean** - belly gets real big and knocks enemies back. Only your belly

**Toy soldier** - familiar that shoots plastic bullets

**Runny nose** - random snot bubble shots (poison knock back)

**Toilet paper** - ground liquids have no effect on you

**Jack in the box** - jacks pop out from you in the direction you are shooting randomly. Instant kill.

**180 gram vinyl** - you now shoot vinyl records and have a beanie, hipster glasses, and hipster beard
