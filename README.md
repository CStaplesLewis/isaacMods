Item Look: Black Scared Cat -- not at all resembling guppy, as this does not count towards the transformation (https://www.google.com/search?q=black+scared+cat&espv=2&biw=1846&bih=990&tbm=isch&imgil=yVAb02nN73FVPM%253A%253BuWdFkuL0krGNsM%253Bhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fclipartfest.com%25252Fcategories%25252Fview%25252F4c14e1d37941dccc075ec9708f8446c6e49eaefc%25252Fscared-black-cat-clipart.html&source=iu&pf=m&fir=yVAb02nN73FVPM%253A%252CuWdFkuL0krGNsM%252C_&usg=__MmJv9bXo3CQmFo_mb2pvKqIePFc%3D&dpr=1&ved=0ahUKEwjpk7_GwdjRAhXCfhoKHbgiDdIQyjcIJw&ei=zxeGWKnwFcL9abjFtJAN)
