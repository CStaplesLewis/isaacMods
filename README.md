~~Item pedestals in this room will reroll their items 1 time just by entering and exiting. The third time you enter the room, all items will become Exiled and will not change from that item. Exiled cannot be rerolled. The Garden has ivy key locks on the outside door. If entered, the floor becomes much harder. Specifically, if a player is playing normal, the floor becomes "hard" difficulty. If the player is playing hard, the floor gains the champion belt effect.~~ 

**Curse of Mortality:** Hearts no longer spawn for the remainder of the floor.

~~**Broken Heart:**  Consumable that cracks your topmost red HP, when that HP is hit, it becomes 3 blue hearts.~~

**Genesis challenge:** Eve starts with Rebirth, Shame, and Forbidden Fruit and must beat the Lamb (on normal difficulty). There are no item rooms.

# The Web Mod:
Challenge rooms have a small chance to become a web room.
This is a wave defense room with only spider enemies that pays out in a special item (or 2 spider items). This enters the moment you begin.

# Misc Mods (considering making these for practice):
**Belly bean** - belly gets real big and knocks enemies back. Only your belly

**Toy soldier** - familiar that shoots plastic bullets

**Runny nose** - random snot bubble shots (poison knock back)

**Toilet paper** - ground liquids have no effect on you

**Jack in the box** - jacks pop out from you in the direction you are shooting randomly. Instant kill.

**180 gram vinyl** - you now shoot vinyl records and have a beanie, hipster glasses, and hipster beard

**It's a Trap!** - Active Item: Spawn 3 trap doors, the player chooses one and the others disappear.  One is a Crawl Space, one is a Black Market, one is an Ehwaz passage
